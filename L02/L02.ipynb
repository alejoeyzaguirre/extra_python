    "Se crea un algoritmo eficiente capaz de rápidamente resolver el problema. Para ello se utilizan dos listas, `espadas_sobrantes` y `bestias_no_matadas`, cada una de estas corresponde a una lista de 26 elementos cada una. El elemento 1 de la primera lista, corresponde a la espada **a** y el elemento 26 a la espada **z**, lo mismo con la lista de `bestias_no_matadas`pero corresponde a las letras mayúsculas.\n",

    "En este desarrollo se utilizará la implementación de A*, sugerida en la materia de clases (https://github.com/jrialland/python-astar). Para ello se instala inicialmente la librería astar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teniendo en cuenta el README.rst se define la clase `Astar_Caballo` que hereda de la clase padre `AStar`. Luego se definen distintos atributos propios de la clases \"hija\", como es el horse_map (la matriz de alturas de cada ubicación geográfica), que tiene un sierto ancho y alto. Se procede con definir los distintos métodos (@abstract_methods) de la clase Astar_Caballo que son las siguientes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) `neighbours`: Este método recibe un nodo del horse_map y entrega sus vecinos correspondientes. Para ello hay que tener sumo cuidado con no quedar \"out of range\" y estar seguro que el código no falla al probar distintos nodos de origen y destino más en los bordes del mapa.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) `distance_between`: Este método recibe dos nodos y calcula el costo entre ellos, para luego retornarlo. En este ejercicio en particular, el costo venía dado por la diferencia de las alturas más uno, si la altura del segundo nodo (nodo destino inmediato) es mayor a la del primero (nodo actual), sino la función retorna 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) `heuristic_cost_estimate`: Este método recibe dos nodos y calcula el **costo heurístico** entre ellos, para luego retornarlo. Se consideró que una medida adecuada para este costo, sería la distancia euclidiana dividida por √2, ya que nunca será mayor al costo para alcanzar el objetivo (recordar que en este caso si se permite avanzar en línea diagonal). Para darme cuenta de eso, utilicé un enfoque iterativo y al ver que la distancia euclidiana fallaba en encontrar la ruta mínima, atiné a dividir esta en √2 y se logró un resultado coherente, y con la distancia de un paso en diagonal normalizado a 1. De esta forma se mantiene una función, que no es muy costosa de computar, computacionalmente hablando y que entrega una solución que permite que A* pueda converger al mínimo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Se define por último el método `is_goal_reached`, que retorna True si el nodo actual es igual al nodo de origen. Habiendo implementado todos estos métodos en la clase hija `Astar_Caballo`, tenemos finalmente un algoritmo de A* que puede resolver el problema.\n"

    "En la siguiente pregunta se aplican los conceptos aprendidos de la materia de árbol. Intenté buscar una buena implementación de Trie pero no pillé, así que armé uno *casero*. Este consiste en la creación de una clase `nodo` que contiene como atributos: una letra, un padre, una frecuencia, una freq_pal y un diccionario de hijos (en que la llave es una letra y los valores los nodos hijos correspondientes a esa letra). El atributo frecuencia denota la frecuencia de la búsqueda con mayor frecuencia que hay al tomar ese camino del árbol (para saber después que camino tomar al aplicar el Löbel Finder). El atributo, freq_pal en cambio, denota la frecuencia de la palabra que termina en ese nodo, si en ese nodo no termina ninguna palabra la freq_pal es cero.\n",

    "Se crea una forma de representar estos nodos, que permite visualizar el árbol de una forma ordenada y con un método  DFS (Depth First Search).\n",

    "Para poder crear el árbol de una manera recursiva, se utiliza la función `recursive_create`, que agrega cada búsqueda al árbol, separando cada caracter y los convierte en nodo agregandoles sus respectivos atributos de frecuencia, freq_pal y de sus respectivos hijos."

Entonces si la estructura tiene solo 3 letras mayúsculas, y el resultado parcial es de la siguiente forma [2, 5, 7], esto implica que el primer slice correspondiente a la primera letra mayúscula será mensaje[0:2], el segundo será mensaje[2:5] y el tercero será mensaje[5:7].\n",
